# Maths-VLab

Maths-VLab is a student-built educational platform designed to make learning mathematics interactive and fun. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS), the platform supports interactive simulations, videos, quizzes, and progress tracking for students, while also offering instructors tools to manage content and connect with learners.

## üîß Tech Stack

* **Frontend**: ReactJS, Tailwind CSS, Axios, Context API / Redux
* **Backend**: NodeJS, ExpressJS
* **Database**: MongoDB (via Mongoose)
* **Authentication**: Refresh Token Strategy, bcrypt

---

## üß© Features

* Interactive study content: Video, Text, Simulation, Quiz, Game
* Dynamic Study Page with tabbed interface for each content type
* Secure Authentication and User Management

## üìÅ System Architecture

Maths-VLab follows a client-server model:

* **Frontend**: Built with ReactJS, it dynamically loads content through lazy loading and React Suspense. It manages the user interface and routes.
* **Backend**: Built with NodeJS and ExpressJS, it provides RESTful APIs for user auth, content management, and progress tracking.
* **Database**: MongoDB stores structured content in separate collections (Topic, VideoContent, Quiz, etc.), with references between them.

Here is a high-level diagram that illustrates the architecture
