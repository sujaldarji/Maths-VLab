## Project Description

Maths-VLab is a fully functional ed-tech platform that enables users to create, consume, and rate educational content. The platform is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS), and it provides:
- **A seamless and interactive learning experience:** Students can access interactive simulations, video lectures, quizzes, and progress tracking.
- **A platform for instructors:** Instructors can create courses, manage content, and connect with learners globally.
- **Robust backend & API design:** Ensures secure authentication, efficient content management, and scalability.
- **SEO-friendly deployment:** Dynamic sitemap generation and RESTful API design for improved search engine indexing.

## System Architecture

Maths-VLab follows a client-server architecture comprising three main components:

- **Frontend:**  
  Built with ReactJS, it uses dynamic, lazy-loaded components to display various types of study content (text, video, simulation, quiz, progress, games). The state management (using Redux or Context API) ensures a responsive, user-friendly interface.
  
- **Backend:**  
  Implemented with NodeJS and ExpressJS, the backend provides RESTful APIs for authentication, content management, course management, and user progress tracking. JWT-based authentication with token refresh, and middleware for secure API access are key features.
  
- **Database:**  
  MongoDB is used as the primary data store with a flexible schema design. Data is organized in multiple collections with references:
  - **Topics**: Contains metadata and references to content.
  - **TextContent, VideoContent, SimulationContent, Quiz, GameContent**: Separate collections for each content type.
  - **Progress**: Tracks user progress across topics.

## Frontend

The client-side is built using ReactJS and leverages modern features such as lazy loading and Suspense to ensure that only the necessary components are loaded on demand. Key pages include:

- **Homepage:** An introduction to Maths-VLab with navigation to course lists and featured content.
- **Study Page:** A dynamic tab interface that loads text, video, simulation, quiz, progress, and game content on demand.
- **User & Instructor Dashboards:** Customized views for students and instructors.
- **Authentication Pages:** Sign In, Sign Up, and password reset functionalities.

### Technologies
- ReactJS, Vite (or Create React App)
- Axios for API calls
- CSS / Tailwind CSS for styling
- Redux or Context API for state management

---

## Backend

The backend is built using NodeJS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB. It includes:

- **Authentication:**  
  Secure user authentication with JWT, refresh tokens, and password reset functionality.
  
- **Content Management:**  
  APIs for creating, updating, and retrieving topics and related content (text, video, simulation, quiz, game).
  
- **User Management:**  
  Endpoints for user profiles, authentication status, and progress tracking.

### Technologies
- NodeJS, ExpressJS
- MongoDB, Mongoose
- JWT, bcryptjs
- Nodemailer for email notifications
- Additional middleware: cors, cookie-parser

## Database Schema

Maths-VLab uses a modular schema design with multiple collections that reference each other:

- **Topic:**  
  Stores domain, topicId, title, description, and references to content (text, video, simulation, quiz, game).

- **TextContent:**  
  Contains text-based study material.

- **VideoContent:**  
  Stores video URL, thumbnail, duration, and description.

- **SimulationContent:**  
  Contains an embed URL and description for interactive simulations.

- **Quiz:**  
  Stores quiz questions, options, correct answers, explanations, and score information.

- **GameContent:**  
  Contains game URL and description.

- **Progress:**  
  Tracks user progress, including completed sections and quiz scores.

## API Design

The RESTful API is designed to ensure efficient communication between the frontend and backend. Key endpoints include:

### **Authentication**
- `POST /api/auth/signup` â€“ Register a new user.
- `POST /api/auth/login` â€“ Log in and generate JWT tokens.
- `POST /api/auth/forgot-password` â€“ Send password reset link.
- `POST /api/reset-password` â€“ Reset password.

### **Topics and Content**
- `GET /api/topics/:topicId` â€“ Retrieve a topic and its content references.
- `GET /api/textContent/:id` â€“ Retrieve text content.
- `GET /api/videoContent/:id` â€“ Retrieve video content.
- `GET /api/simulationContent/:id` â€“ Retrieve simulation content.
- `GET /api/quiz/:id` â€“ Retrieve quiz data.
- `GET /api/gameContent/:id` â€“ Retrieve game content.

### **User Progress**
- `GET /api/progress/:userId` â€“ Retrieve user progress data.
- `POST /api/progress/:userId/:topicId` â€“ Create/update progress record.

## Deployment

The deployment process involves:
- **Building the Frontend:**  
  Use Vite (or Create React App) to build the production version.
- **Deploying the Backend:**  
  Host the Express server on a cloud provider (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean).
- **Database Hosting:**  
  Use MongoDB Atlas for a managed cloud database solution.
- **Environment Configuration:**  
  Use environment variables for sensitive information and configuration.
- **Sitemap & SEO:**  
  Generate a sitemap dynamically and configure robots.txt to enhance SEO.

---

## Testing

The platform is tested using:
- **Unit Testing:** Jest and React Testing Library for frontend components.
- **Integration Testing:** Supertest and Mocha/Chai for backend endpoints.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Cypress for simulating user interactions.

---

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements include:
- **Enhanced Analytics:** More detailed insights for instructors and admin.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Integrate WebSockets for live discussions and collaborative problem-solving.
- **Advanced User Personalization:** Machine learning-based recommendations for courses.
- **Mobile App:** Develop a mobile version for a seamless learning experience.
- **Additional Content Types:** Expand content to include interactive assignments, AR/VR experiences, etc.
