        <h1 id="introduction-to-algebra">Introduction to Algebra</h1>

        <h2 id="what-is-algebra">1. What is Algebra?</h2>
        <p>Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols, typically letters, to represent numbers in equations
            and expressions. These symbols, known as variables, allow us to generalize arithmetic operations and solve
            problems involving unknown values. Algebra serves as a foundational tool in mathematics, enabling us to
            formulate and solve equations that model real-world situations.</p>
        <h3 id="key-components">Key Components:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Symbols (e.g., \( x, y, z \)) representing unknown or changeable values.
                Variables can take on different values, making them essential for expressing general relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Constants:</strong> Fixed values (e.g., \( 5, -3, 12 \)) that do not change. Constants are used
                in equations to provide specific numerical values.</li>
            <li><strong>Operators:</strong> Mathematical symbols denoting operations (e.g., \( +, -, \times, \div \)).
                Operators define how variables and constants interact in an equation.</li>
            <li><strong>Expressions:</strong> Combinations of variables, constants, and operators (e.g., \( 3x + 2 \)).
                Expressions do not have an equality sign and can be simplified or evaluated.</li>
            <li><strong>Equations:</strong> Mathematical statements that assert the equality of two expressions (e.g.,
                \( 2x + 3 = 7 \)). Equations can be solved to find the value of the variable.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="types-of-algebra">Types of Algebra:</h3>
        <p>Algebra can be categorized into several types, each with its own focus and applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li id="elementary-algebra"><strong>Elementary Algebra:</strong> The most basic form of algebra, dealing with the manipulation of
                simple equations and expressions. It introduces fundamental concepts such as solving linear equations
                and working with polynomials.</li>
            <li id="abstract-algebra"><strong>Abstract Algebra:</strong> A more advanced branch that studies algebraic structures such as
                groups, rings, and fields. Abstract algebra is essential in higher mathematics and theoretical physics.
            </li>
            <li id="linear-algebra"><strong>Linear Algebra:</strong> Focuses on vector spaces and linear mappings between them. It is widely
                used in computer science, engineering, and data analysis.</li>
            <li id="boolean-algebra"><strong>Boolean Algebra:</strong> A branch of algebra that deals with true or false values, often used
                in computer science and logic. It involves operations like AND, OR, and NOT.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="example-equations">Example Equations:</h3>
        <p>Example equation:</p>
        <p>\( x + 5 = 12 \)</p>
        <p>Here, \( x \) is a variable representing an unknown number. To find \( x \), we can subtract 5 from both
            sides:</p>
        <p>\( x = 12 - 5 = 7 \)</p>
        <p>Another example:</p>
        <p>Quadratic equation: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \)</p>
        <p>Where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are constants. The solutions can be found using the quadratic formula:</p>
        <p>\( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \)</p>
        <h3 id="applications-of-algebra">Applications of Algebra:</h3>
        <p>Algebra is used in various fields and everyday life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Science and Engineering:</strong> Algebraic equations are used to model physical phenomena, such
                as motion, energy, and forces.</li>
            <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Algebra helps in calculating interest rates, loan payments, and investment
                growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Computer Science:</strong> Algorithms and data structures often rely on algebraic concepts for
                efficiency and optimization.</li>
            <li><strong>Statistics:</strong> Algebra is used in formulating statistical models and analyzing data
                trends.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="advanced-concepts">Advanced Concepts:</h3>
        <p>As one progresses in algebra, several advanced concepts become important:</p>
        <ul>
            <li id="functions"><strong>Functions:</strong> A function is a relation that assigns exactly one output for each input.
                Functions can be linear, quadratic, exponential, etc. For example, the function \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \)
                describes a linear relationship.</li>
            <li id="systems-of-equations"><strong>Systems of Equations:</strong> These involve solving multiple equations simultaneously. For
                example, the system:</li>
            <ul>
                <li> \( 2x + 3y = 6 \)</li>
                <li> \( x - y = 2 \)</li>
            </ul>


            <h2 id="fundamental-concepts-in-algebra">2. Fundamental Concepts in Algebra</h2>
            <h3 id="variables-and-constants">2.1 Variables and Constants</h3>
            <p>Variables are letters representing numbers whose values are unknown or can change. They are essential in
                algebra as they allow us to formulate general rules and relationships. For example, in the expression \(
                3x + 2 \), \( x \) is a variable that can take on different values, making it possible to express a wide
                range of mathematical relationships.</p>
            <p>Constants, on the other hand, are specific, unchanging numbers that do not vary. They provide fixed
                values in equations and expressions. For instance, in \( 3x + 2 \), the numbers 3 and 2 are constants.
                Constants can be positive, negative, or zero, and they play a crucial role in defining the behavior of
                algebraic expressions.</p>
            <h3 id="algebraic-expressions">2.2 Algebraic Expressions</h3>
            <p>An algebraic expression is a combination of variables, constants, and operators (such as addition,
                subtraction, multiplication, and division). These expressions can represent a wide variety of
                mathematical relationships and can be simplified or manipulated to solve problems.</p>
            <p>Example: The expression \( 4x - 7 \) consists of the variable \( x \), the constant -7, and the operator
                - (subtraction). Algebraic expressions can be evaluated by substituting specific values for the
                variables. For instance, if \( x = 3 \), then:</p>
            <p>\( 4(3) - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \)</p>
            <p>Algebraic expressions can also be classified based on the number of terms they contain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monomial:</strong> An expression with one term (e.g., \( 5x^2 \)).</li>
                <li><strong>Binomial:</strong> An expression with two terms (e.g., \( 3x + 4 \)).</li>
                <li><strong>Trinomial:</strong> An expression with three terms (e.g., \( x^2 - 2x + 1 \)).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="terms-and-coefficients">2.3 Terms and Coefficients</h3>
            <p>In algebra, a term is an individual part of an expression that can be a constant, a variable, or a
                combination of both multiplied together. Terms are separated by addition or subtraction operators.</p>
            <p>Example: In the expression \( 5x^2 - 3x + 7 \), the terms are \( 5x^2 \), \( -3x \), and \( 7 \). Each
                term can be evaluated independently, and they can be combined through addition or subtraction.</p>
            <p>Coefficients are the numerical factors that multiply the variables in a term. They indicate how many
                times the variable is counted in that term. For example, in the term \( 5x^2 \), the coefficient is 5,
                meaning that \( x^2 \) is multiplied by 5. In the term \( -3x \), the coefficient is -3, indicating that
                \( x \) is multiplied by -3.</p>
            <p>Understanding terms and coefficients is crucial for simplifying expressions and solving equations. For
                instance, when combining like terms (terms that have the same variable raised to the same power), you
                can add or subtract their coefficients:</p>
            <p>Example: In the expression \( 5x^2 - 3x + 2x^2 + 7 \), you can combine \( 5x^2 \) and \( 2x^2 \) to get
                \( 7x^2 \), resulting in \( 7x^2 - 3x + 7 \).</p>

                <h3 id="equations-and-inequalities" >2.4 Equations and Inequalities (continued)</h3>
                <p>In contrast, an inequality is a mathematical statement that indicates one expression is greater than
                    or less than another. Inequalities use symbols such as \( > \) (greater than), \( < \) (less than),
                        \( \geq \) (greater than or equal to), and \( \leq \) (less than or equal to).</p>
                        <p>Example: In the inequality \( x - 4 > 2 \), we can solve for \( x \) by isolating it:</p>
                        <p>Step 1: Add 4 to both sides:</p>
                        <p>\( x > 2 + 4 \)</p>
                        <p>Step 2: Simplify:</p>
                        <p>\( x > 6 \)</p>
                        <p>This means that \( x \) can take any value greater than 6.</p>
                        <p>Itâ€™s important to note that when you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a
                            negative number, the direction of the inequality sign must be reversed. For example:</p>
                        <p>If \( -2x < 6 \), dividing both sides by -2 gives:</p>
                                <p>\( x > -3 \)</p>

                                <h3 id="addition-and-subtraction-of-like-terms">3.1 Addition and Subtraction of Like Terms</h3>
                                <p>In algebra, like terms are terms that have the same variable(s) raised to the same
                                    power. They can be combined through addition or subtraction because they represent
                                    the same quantity. This operation simplifies expressions and makes calculations
                                    easier.</p>
                                <p>Example: In the expression \( 3x + 5x \), both terms are like terms because they both
                                    contain the variable \( x \). To combine them, you simply add their coefficients:
                                </p>
                                <p>\( 3x + 5x = (3 + 5)x = 8x \)</p>
                                <p>Another example: Consider the expression \( 4y^2 - 2y^2 + 7y \). Here, \( 4y^2 \) and
                                    \( -2y^2 \) are like terms, while \( 7y \) is a different term. You can combine the
                                    like terms:</p>
                                <p>\( 4y^2 - 2y^2 = (4 - 2)y^2 = 2y^2 \)</p>
                                <p>Thus, the simplified expression is \( 2y^2 + 7y \).</p>
                                <p>Itâ€™s important to note that you cannot combine unlike terms. For example, in the
                                    expression \( 3x + 4y \), \( 3x \) and \( 4y \) are not like terms, so they remain

                                        overview of these operations:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Addition:</strong> Combine like terms. For example, \( (3x^2 + 2x) +

                                            (5x^3 + 2x) - (3x^3 - 4) = (5x^3 - 3x^3) + 2x + 4 = 2x^3 + 2x + 4 \).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Multiplication:</strong> Use the distributive property to multiply
                                            polynomials. For example, \( (x + 2)(x + 3) = x^2 + 3x + 2x + 6 = x^2 + 5x +
                                            6 \).</li>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Polynomial Long Division:</strong> This method is similar to long
                                            division with numbers. You divide the leading term of the dividend by the
                                            leading term of the divisor, multiply the entire divisor by that result,
                                            subtract it from the dividend, and repeat the process with the new
                                            polynomial until you reach a remainder that is of lower degree than the
                                            divisor.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Synthetic Division:</strong> This is a shortcut method for dividing
                                            a polynomial by a linear divisor of the form \( x - c \). It is generally
                                            faster and involves fewer steps than polynomial long division. You set up a
                                            synthetic division table using the coefficients of the polynomial and the
                                            value of \( c \).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p> Example of Polynomial Long Division: Divide \( 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 2 \) by \( x + 1
                                        \).</p>
                                    Step 1: Divide the leading term: \( 2x^3 \div x = 2x^2 \). <br>Step 2: Multiply \( 2x^2 \) by \( x + 1 \): \( 2x^3 + 2x^2 \). <br>Step 3: Subtract: \( (2x^3 + 3x^2 - 2) - (2x^3 + 2x^2) = x^2 - 2 \). <br>Step 4: Repeat with \( x^2 - 2 \) divided by \( x + 1 \).

Step 1: Calculate the discriminant. D = b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1.

Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula. x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{1}}{2(1)} = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2}. 
                                    <p> Step 3: Solve for the two possible values of \( x \). </p>
                                  x = \frac{6}{2} = 3 or x = \frac{4}{2} = 2
                                    <p>Thus, using the quadratic formula, we again find the solutions to the equation \(
                                        x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).</p>
