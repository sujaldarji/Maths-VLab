        <h1>Introduction to Algebra</h1>

        <h2>1. What is Algebra?</h2>
        <p>Algebra is a branch of mathematics that uses symbols, typically letters, to represent numbers in equations
            and expressions. These symbols, known as variables, allow us to generalize arithmetic operations and solve
            problems involving unknown values. Algebra serves as a foundational tool in mathematics, enabling us to
            formulate and solve equations that model real-world situations.</p>
        <h3>Key Components:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Symbols (e.g., \( x, y, z \)) representing unknown or changeable values.
                Variables can take on different values, making them essential for expressing general relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Constants:</strong> Fixed values (e.g., \( 5, -3, 12 \)) that do not change. Constants are used
                in equations to provide specific numerical values.</li>
            <li><strong>Operators:</strong> Mathematical symbols denoting operations (e.g., \( +, -, \times, \div \)).
                Operators define how variables and constants interact in an equation.</li>
            <li><strong>Expressions:</strong> Combinations of variables, constants, and operators (e.g., \( 3x + 2 \)).
                Expressions do not have an equality sign and can be simplified or evaluated.</li>
            <li><strong>Equations:</strong> Mathematical statements that assert the equality of two expressions (e.g.,
                \( 2x + 3 = 7 \)). Equations can be solved to find the value of the variable.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Types of Algebra:</h3>
        <p>Algebra can be categorized into several types, each with its own focus and applications:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Elementary Algebra:</strong> The most basic form of algebra, dealing with the manipulation of
                simple equations and expressions. It introduces fundamental concepts such as solving linear equations
                and working with polynomials.</li>
            <li><strong>Abstract Algebra:</strong> A more advanced branch that studies algebraic structures such as
                groups, rings, and fields. Abstract algebra is essential in higher mathematics and theoretical physics.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Linear Algebra:</strong> Focuses on vector spaces and linear mappings between them. It is widely
                used in computer science, engineering, and data analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Boolean Algebra:</strong> A branch of algebra that deals with true or false values, often used
                in computer science and logic. It involves operations like AND, OR, and NOT.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example Equations:</h3>
        <p>Example equation:</p>
        <p>\( x + 5 = 12 \)</p>
        <p>Here, \( x \) is a variable representing an unknown number. To find \( x \), we can subtract 5 from both
            sides:</p>
        <p>\( x = 12 - 5 = 7 \)</p>
        <p>Another example:</p>
        <p>Quadratic equation: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \)</p>
        <p>Where \( a, b, \) and \( c \) are constants. The solutions can be found using the quadratic formula:</p>
        <p>\( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \)</p>
        <h3>Applications of Algebra:</h3>
        <p>Algebra is used in various fields and everyday life:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Science and Engineering:</strong> Algebraic equations are used to model physical phenomena, such
                as motion, energy, and forces.</li>
            <li><strong>Finance:</strong> Algebra helps in calculating interest rates, loan payments, and investment
                growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Computer Science:</strong> Algorithms and data structures often rely on algebraic concepts for
                efficiency and optimization.</li>
            <li><strong>Statistics:</strong> Algebra is used in formulating statistical models and analyzing data
                trends.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Advanced Concepts:</h3>
        <p>As one progresses in algebra, several advanced concepts become important:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Functions:</strong> A function is a relation that assigns exactly one output for each input.
                Functions can be linear, quadratic, exponential, etc. For example, the function \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \)
                describes a linear relationship.</li>
            <li><strong>Systems of Equations:</strong> These involve solving multiple equations simultaneously. For
                example, the system:</li>
            <ul>
                <li> \( 2x + 3y = 6 \)</li>
                <li> \( x - y = 2 \)</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>2. Fundamental Concepts in Algebra</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Variables and Constants</h3>
            <p>Variables are letters representing numbers whose values are unknown or can change. They are essential in
                algebra as they allow us to formulate general rules and relationships. For example, in the expression \(
                3x + 2 \), \( x \) is a variable that can take on different values, making it possible to express a wide
                range of mathematical relationships.</p>
            <p>Constants, on the other hand, are specific, unchanging numbers that do not vary. They provide fixed
                values in equations and expressions. For instance, in \( 3x + 2 \), the numbers 3 and 2 are constants.
                Constants can be positive, negative, or zero, and they play a crucial role in defining the behavior of
                algebraic expressions.</p>
            <h3>2.2 Algebraic Expressions</h3>
            <p>An algebraic expression is a combination of variables, constants, and operators (such as addition,
                subtraction, multiplication, and division). These expressions can represent a wide variety of
                mathematical relationships and can be simplified or manipulated to solve problems.</p>
            <p>Example: The expression \( 4x - 7 \) consists of the variable \( x \), the constant -7, and the operator
                - (subtraction). Algebraic expressions can be evaluated by substituting specific values for the
                variables. For instance, if \( x = 3 \), then:</p>
            <p>\( 4(3) - 7 = 12 - 7 = 5 \)</p>
            <p>Algebraic expressions can also be classified based on the number of terms they contain:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Monomial:</strong> An expression with one term (e.g., \( 5x^2 \)).</li>
                <li><strong>Binomial:</strong> An expression with two terms (e.g., \( 3x + 4 \)).</li>
                <li><strong>Trinomial:</strong> An expression with three terms (e.g., \( x^2 - 2x + 1 \)).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.3 Terms and Coefficients</h3>
            <p>In algebra, a term is an individual part of an expression that can be a constant, a variable, or a
                combination of both multiplied together. Terms are separated by addition or subtraction operators.</p>
            <p>Example: In the expression \( 5x^2 - 3x + 7 \), the terms are \( 5x^2 \), \( -3x \), and \( 7 \). Each
                term can be evaluated independently, and they can be combined through addition or subtraction.</p>
            <p>Coefficients are the numerical factors that multiply the variables in a term. They indicate how many
                times the variable is counted in that term. For example, in the term \( 5x^2 \), the coefficient is 5,
                meaning that \( x^2 \) is multiplied by 5. In the term \( -3x \), the coefficient is -3, indicating that
                \( x \) is multiplied by -3.</p>
            <p>Understanding terms and coefficients is crucial for simplifying expressions and solving equations. For
                instance, when combining like terms (terms that have the same variable raised to the same power), you
                can add or subtract their coefficients:</p>
            <p>Example: In the expression \( 5x^2 - 3x + 2x^2 + 7 \), you can combine \( 5x^2 \) and \( 2x^2 \) to get
                \( 7x^2 \), resulting in \( 7x^2 - 3x + 7 \).</p>
            <h3>
                <h3>2.4 Equations and Inequalities (continued)</h3>
                <p>In contrast, an inequality is a mathematical statement that indicates one expression is greater than
                    or less than another. Inequalities use symbols such as \( > \) (greater than), \( < \) (less than),
                        \( \geq \) (greater than or equal to), and \( \leq \) (less than or equal to).</p>
                        <p>Example: In the inequality \( x - 4 > 2 \), we can solve for \( x \) by isolating it:</p>
                        <p>Step 1: Add 4 to both sides:</p>
                        <p>\( x > 2 + 4 \)</p>
                        <p>Step 2: Simplify:</p>
                        <p>\( x > 6 \)</p>
                        <p>This means that \( x \) can take any value greater than 6.</p>
                        <p>Itâ€™s important to note that when you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a
                            negative number, the direction of the inequality sign must be reversed. For example:</p>
                        <p>If \( -2x < 6 \), dividing both sides by -2 gives:</p>
                                <p>\( x > -3 \)</p>
                                <h3>2.5 Solving Linear Equations</h3>
                                <p>Linear equations are equations of the first degree, meaning they involve variables
                                    raised to the power of one. The general form of a linear equation in one variable
                                    is:</p>
                                <p>\( ax + b = 0 \)</p>
                                <p>Where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, and \( x \) is the variable. To solve a
                                    linear equation, the goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation.
                                </p>
                                <p>Example: Solve the equation \( 3x + 5 = 14 \):</p>
                                <p>Step 1: Subtract 5 from both sides:</p>
                                <p>\( 3x = 14 - 5 \)</p>
                                <p>Step 2: Simplify:</p>
                                <p>\( 3x = 9 \)</p>
                                <p>Step 3: Divide by 3:</p>
                                <p>\( x = 3 \)</p>
                                <h3>2.6 Solving Quadratic Equations</h3>
                                <p>Quadratic equations are equations of the second degree, typically in the form:</p>
                                <p>\( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \)</p>
                                <p>Where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants, and \( a \neq 0 \). There are
                                    several methods to solve quadratic equations:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Factoring:</strong> If the quadratic can be factored, it can be
                                        expressed as \( (px + q)(rx + s) = 0 \).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Quadratic Formula:</strong> The solutions can be found using the
                                        formula:</li>
                                    <p>\( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \)</p>
                                    <li><strong>Completing the Square:</strong> This method involves rearranging the
                                        equation into a perfect square trinomial.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Example: Solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) by factoring:</p>
                                <p>Step 1: Factor the equation:</p>
                                <p>\( (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \)</p>
                                <p>Step 2: Set each factor to zero:</p>
                                <p>\( x - 2 = 0 \) or \( x - 3 = 0 \)</p>
                                <p>Step 3: Solve for \( x \):</p>
                                <p>\( x = 2 \) or \( x = 3 \)</p>
                                <h3>2.7 Functions and Their Properties (continued)</h3>
                                <p>Functions can be classified based on their properties:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Linear Functions:</strong> Functions that create a straight line when
                                        graphed (e.g., \( f(x) = 2x + 3 \)). The general form of a linear function is \(
                                        f(x) = mx + b \), where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept. The
                                        slope indicates the steepness of the line, while the y-intercept is the point
                                        where the line crosses the y-axis.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Quadratic Functions:</strong> Functions that create a parabolic shape
                                        when graphed (e.g., \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 3 \)). The general form is \( f(x) =
                                        ax^2 + bx + c \). The graph of a quadratic function opens upwards if \( a > 0 \)
                                        and downwards if \( a < 0 \).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Exponential Functions:</strong> Functions that involve an exponent with
                                        a constant base (e.g., \( f(x) = 2^x \)). These functions grow rapidly and are
                                        characterized by their constant percentage growth rate.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Logarithmic Functions:</strong> The inverse of exponential functions
                                        (e.g., \( f(x) = \log_b(x) \)). Logarithmic functions grow slowly and are used
                                        to solve equations involving exponential growth.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Piecewise Functions:</strong> Functions defined by different expressions
                                        for different intervals of the input variable (e.g., \( f(x) = \begin{cases} x^2
                                        & \text{if } x < 0 \\ 2x + 1 & \text{if } x \geq 0 \end{cases} \)).</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3>2.8 Graphing Algebraic Expressions</h3>
                                <p>Graphing is a visual representation of algebraic expressions and functions. The graph
                                    of a function shows the relationship between the input (x-axis) and output (y-axis).
                                    Understanding how to graph different types of functions is crucial in algebra.</p>
                                <p>To graph a linear function, you can follow these steps:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Identify the slope (\( m \)) and y-intercept (\( b \)) from the equation \( f(x)
                                        = mx + b \).</li>
                                    <li>Plot the y-intercept on the graph.</li>
                                    <li>Use the slope to determine another point on the line. For example, a slope of \(
                                        \frac{2}{1} \) means you rise 2 units up and run 1 unit to the right.</li>
                                    <li>Draw a straight line through the points.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>For quadratic functions, the graph is a parabola. To graph a quadratic function:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Find the vertex, which is the highest or lowest point of the parabola.</li>
                                    <li>Determine the axis of symmetry, which is a vertical line that passes through the
                                        vertex.</li>
                                    <li>Identify the y-intercept by evaluating \( f(0) \).</li>
                                    <li>Plot additional points on either side of the vertex to create the parabolic
                                        shape.</li>

                                <h2>3. Basic Operations in Algebra</h2>
                                <h3>3.1 Addition and Subtraction of Like Terms</h3>
                                <p>In algebra, like terms are terms that have the same variable(s) raised to the same
                                    power. They can be combined through addition or subtraction because they represent
                                    the same quantity. This operation simplifies expressions and makes calculations
                                    easier.</p>
                                <p>Example: In the expression \( 3x + 5x \), both terms are like terms because they both
                                    contain the variable \( x \). To combine them, you simply add their coefficients:
                                </p>
                                <p>\( 3x + 5x = (3 + 5)x = 8x \)</p>
                                <p>Another example: Consider the expression \( 4y^2 - 2y^2 + 7y \). Here, \( 4y^2 \) and
                                    \( -2y^2 \) are like terms, while \( 7y \) is a different term. You can combine the
                                    like terms:</p>
                                <p>\( 4y^2 - 2y^2 = (4 - 2)y^2 = 2y^2 \)</p>
                                <p>Thus, the simplified expression is \( 2y^2 + 7y \).</p>
                                <p>Itâ€™s important to note that you cannot combine unlike terms. For example, in the
                                    expression \( 3x + 4y \), \( 3x \) and \( 4y \) are not like terms, so they remain
                                    separate.</p>
                                <h3>3.2 Multiplication and Division of Terms</h3>
                                <p>Multiplication and division of algebraic terms follow specific rules that are
                                    essential for simplifying expressions and solving equations.</p>
                                <h4>Multiplication of Terms</h4>
                                <p>When multiplying terms, you multiply the coefficients and add the exponents of like
                                    bases. The general rule is:</p>
                                <p>If \( a^m \times a^n = a^{m+n} \), where \( a \) is the base and \( m \) and \( n \)
                                    are the exponents.</p>
                                <p>Example: For the multiplication \( 2x \times 3x \):</p>
                                <p>Step 1: Multiply the coefficients: \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \)</p>
                                <p>Step 2: Multiply the variables: \( x \times x = x^2 \)</p>
                                <p>Thus, \( 2x \times 3x = 6x^2 \).</p>
                                <h4>Division of Terms</h4>
                                <p>When dividing terms, you divide the coefficients and subtract the exponents of like
                                    bases. The general rule is:</p>
                                <p>If \( \frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m-n} \), where \( a \) is the base and \( m \) and \( n \)
                                    are the exponents.</p>
                                <p>Example: For the division \( \frac{6x^2}{2x} \):</p>
                                <p>Step 1: Divide the coefficients: \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)</p>
                                <p>Step 2: Divide the variables: \( \frac{x^2}{x} = x^{2-1} = x^1 = x \)</p>
                                <p>Thus, \( \frac{6x^2}{2x} = 3x \).</p>
                                <h3>3.3 Distributive Property</h3>
                                <p>The distributive property is a fundamental principle in algebra that allows you to
                                    multiply a single term by a sum or difference within parentheses. The property
                                    states:</p>
                                <p>For any numbers \( a, b, \) and \( c \): \( a(b + c) = ab + ac \)</p>
                                <p>Example: If you have \( 3(x + 4) \), you can distribute the 3:</p>
                                <p>Step 1: Multiply 3 by \( x \): \( 3x \)</p>
                                <p>Step 2: Multiply 3 by 4: \( 12 \)</p>
                                <p>Thus, \( 3(x + 4) = 3x + 12 \).</p>
                                <p>Another example: For \( 2(3y - 5) \):</p>
                                <p>Step 1: Multiply 2 by \( 3y \): \( 6y \)</p>
                                <p>Step 2: Multiply 2 by -5: \( -10 \)</p>
                                <p>Thus, \( 2(3y - 5) = 6y - 10 \).</p>

                                    <h2>4. Solving Linear Equations</h2>
                                    <p>Linear equations are equations of the first degree, meaning they involve
                                        variables raised to the power of one. The general form of a linear equation in
                                        one variable is:</p>
                                    <p>\( ax + b = 0 \)</p>
                                    <p>Where \( a \) and \( b \) are constants, and \( x \) is the variable. The goal of
                                        solving a linear equation is to isolate the variable on one side of the
                                        equation.</p>
                                    <h3>4.1 Steps to Solve Linear Equations</h3>
                                    <p>To solve a linear equation, you can follow these general steps:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li><strong>Isolate the variable:</strong> Use inverse operations to move
                                            constants to the other side of the equation.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Simplify:</strong> Combine like terms and simplify both sides of the
                                            equation as needed.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Check your solution:</strong> Substitute the solution back into the
                                            original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation.</li>
                                    </ol>
                                    <h3>4.2 Example: Solve \( 3x - 5 = 10 \)</h3>
                                    <p>Letâ€™s go through the steps to solve the equation \( 3x - 5 = 10 \):</p>
                                    <pre> Step 1: Add 5 to both sides to isolate the term with the variable. <br>3x - 5 + 5 = 10 + 5 <br>3x = 15<br>Step 2: Divide both sides by 3 to solve for x. <br>3x / 3 = 15 / 3 x = 5 </pre>
                                    <p>Thus, the solution to the equation \( 3x - 5 = 10 \) is \( x = 5 \).</p>
                                    <h3>4.3 Checking the Solution</h3>
                                    <p>To ensure that our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into
                                        the original equation:</p>
                                    <pre> 3(5) - 5 = 10 <br>15 - 5 = 10 <br>10 = 10 </pre>
                                    <p>Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>4.4 Additional Examples</h3>
                                    <p>Letâ€™s look at a few more examples of solving linear equations:</p>
                                    <h4>Example 1: Solve \( 2x + 4 = 12 \)</h4>
                                    <pre> Step 1: Subtract 4 from both sides.<br> 2x + 4 - 4 = 12 - 4 <br>2x = 8
Step 2: Divide both sides by 2.<br> 2x / 2 = 8 / 2 <br>x = 4 </pre>

                                    <p>Thus, the solution is \( x = 4 \).</p>
                                    <h4>Example 2: Solve \( 5x - 3 = 2x + 9 \)</h4>
                                    <pre> Step 1: Move all terms involving x to one side and constants to the other side.<br> 5x - 2x = 9 + 3 <br>3x = 12
Step 2: Divide both sides by 3. <br>3x / 3 = 12 / 3 <br>x = 4 </pre>

                                    <p>Thus, the solution is \( x = 4 \).</p>
                                    <h3>4.5 Solving Equations with No Solution or Infinite Solutions</h3>
                                    <p>Sometimes, a linear equation may have no solution or infinitely many solutions:
                                    </p>
                                    <h4>No Solution</h4>
                                    <p>An equation has no solution when the variables cancel out and you are left with a
                                        false statement. For example:</p>
                                    <p>Example: Solve \( 2x + 3 = 2x - 5 \)</p>
                                    <pre> Step 1: Subtract  2x  from both sides. 2x + 3 - 2x = 2x - 5 - 2x <br>3 = -5 (false statement) </pre>
                                    <p>Since \( 3 \neq -5 \), there is no solution.</p>
                                    <h4>Infinite Solutions</h4>
                                    <p>An equation has infinitely many solutions when the variables cancel out, and you
                                        are left with a true statement. This means that any value of the variable will
                                        satisfy the equation.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Solve the equation \( 4x + 2 = 2(2x + 1) \).</p>
                                    <pre> Step 1: Expand the right side. 4x + 2 = 2(2x) + 2(1)<br>4x + 2 = 4x + 2<br>Step 2: Subtract ( 4x ) from both sides.<br>4x + 2 - 4x = 4x + 2 - 4x <br>2 = 2 (true statement) </pre>

                                    <p>Since \( 2 = 2 \) is always true, this equation has infinitely many solutions.
                                        Any value of \( x \) will satisfy the equation.</p>
                                    <h3>4.6 Summary</h3>

                                    <p>In this formula:</p>
                                    <ul>

                                    </ul>
                                    <p> Example Calculation: If the length of the rectangle is \( 8 \) units and the
                                        width is \( 3 \) units, we can calculate the area as follows:</p>
                                    <pre> Step 1: Identify the values. Length = 8 units Width = 3 units <br>Step 2: Substitute the values into the formula. A = length Ã— width A = 8 Ã— 3 <br>Step 3: Perform the multiplication. A = 24 square units </pre>

                                    <p>Thus, the area of the rectangle is \( 24 \) square units.</p>

                                    <p>Polynomials are algebraic expressions that consist of variables raised to whole
                                        number powers and their coefficients. They are fundamental in algebra and serve
                                        as the building blocks for more complex mathematical concepts.</p>
                                    <h3>6.1 Definition of a Polynomial</h3>

                                    <p>\[ P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + a_0 \]</p>
                                    <p>Where:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>\( P(x) \) is the polynomial function.</li>

                                    </ul>
                                    <h3>6.2 Types of Polynomials</h3> Polynomials can be classified based on their
                                    degree and the number of terms: <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Monomial:</strong> A polynomial with one term (e.g., \( 3x^2 \)).
                                        </li>
                                        <li><strong>Binomial:</strong> A polynomial with two terms (e.g., \( x^2 + 5
                                            \)).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Trinomial:</strong> A polynomial with three terms (e.g., \( 2x^2 -

                                        <li><strong>Polynomial of Degree n:</strong> The highest power of the variable
                                            \( x \) determines the degree of the polynomial. For example, in \( 4x^3 -
                                            2x^2 + 7x - 5 \), the degree is 3.</li>

                                    <h3>6.3 Example of a Polynomial</h3>
                                    <p>Consider the polynomial:</p>

                                        </li>
                                        <li>The constant term is \( -5 \) (the term without the variable).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3>6.4 Evaluating Polynomials</h3>
                                    <p>To evaluate a polynomial, substitute a specific value for the variable \( x \)
                                        and perform the calculations. For example, to evaluate \( P(x) = 4x^3 - 2x^2 +
                                        7x - 5 \) at \( x = 2 \):</p>
                                  Step 1: Substitute \( x = 2 \) into the polynomial. \( P(2) = 4(2)^3 - 2(2)^2 + 7(2) - 5 \)<br>
                                  Step 2: Calculate each term. = 4(8) - 2(4) + 14 - 5 = 32 - 8 + 14 - 5<br>
                                  Step 3: Combine the results. = 32 - 8 + 14 - 5 = 33 
                                   
                                    <p>Thus, \( P(2) = 33 \).</p>

                                    <p>Polynomials can be added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided. Hereâ€™s a brief
                                        overview of these operations:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Addition:</strong> Combine like terms. For example, \( (3x^2 + 2x) +
                                            (4x^2 - 5) = (3x^2 + 4x^2) + 2x - 5 = 7x^2 + 2x - 5 \).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Subtraction:</strong> Subtract corresponding terms. For example, \(
                                            (5x^3 + 2x) - (3x^3 - 4) = (5x^3 - 3x^3) + 2x + 4 = 2x^3 + 2x + 4 \).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Multiplication:</strong> Use the distributive property to multiply
                                            polynomials. For example, \( (x + 2)(x + 3) = x^2 + 3x + 2x + 6 = x^2 + 5x +
                                            6 \).</li>
                                        <li><strong>Division:</strong> Polynomial long division or synthetic division
                                            can be used to divide polynomials.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <h3>6.6 Division of Polynomials</h3>
                                    <p>When dividing polynomials, there are two primary methods: polynomial long
                                        division and synthetic division. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each method:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><strong>Polynomial Long Division:</strong> This method is similar to long
                                            division with numbers. You divide the leading term of the dividend by the
                                            leading term of the divisor, multiply the entire divisor by that result,
                                            subtract it from the dividend, and repeat the process with the new
                                            polynomial until you reach a remainder that is of lower degree than the
                                            divisor.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Synthetic Division:</strong> This is a shortcut method for dividing
                                            a polynomial by a linear divisor of the form \( x - c \). It is generally
                                            faster and involves fewer steps than polynomial long division. You set up a
                                            synthetic division table using the coefficients of the polynomial and the
                                            value of \( c \).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p> Example of Polynomial Long Division: Divide \( 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 2 \) by \( x + 1
                                        \).</p>
                                    Step 1: Divide the leading term: \( 2x^3 \div x = 2x^2 \). <br>Step 2: Multiply \( 2x^2 \) by \( x + 1 \): \( 2x^3 + 2x^2 \). <br>Step 3: Subtract: \( (2x^3 + 3x^2 - 2) - (2x^3 + 2x^2) = x^2 - 2 \). <br>Step 4: Repeat with \( x^2 - 2 \) divided by \( x + 1 \).

                                    <p>To factor a trinomial of the form \( ax^2 + bx + c \), you look for two numbers
                                        that multiply to \( ac \) and add to \( b \). Hereâ€™s an example:</p>
                                    <p> Example: Factor \( 2x^2 + 7x + 3 \).</p>
                                     Step 1: Multiply \( a \) and \( c \): 2 * 3 = 6.<br> Step 2: Find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to 7: 6 and 1.<br> Step 3: Rewrite the middle term: 2x^2 + 6x + 1x + 3. <br>Step 4: Factor by grouping: - Group the first two terms: \( 2x(x + 3) \) - Group the last two terms: \( 1(x + 3) \) <br>Step 5: Factor out the common binomial: - \( (x + 3)(2x + 1) \) 
                                    <p>Thus, the factored form of \( 2x^2 + 7x + 3 \) is \( (x + 3)(2x + 1) \).</p>
                                    <h3>7.6 Difference of Squares</h3>
                                    <p>The difference of squares is a special factoring case that applies to expressions
                                        of the form \( a^2 - b^2 \). This can be factored as:</p>
                                    <p>\( a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \)</p>
                                    <p> Example: Factor \( x^2 - 16 \).</p>
                                     Step 1: Recognize that \( 16 \) is \( 4^2 \). <br>Step 2: Apply the difference of squares formula: - \( x^2 - 4^2 = (x - 4)(x + 4) \) 
                                    <p>Thus, the factored form of \( x^2 - 16 \) is \( (x - 4)(x + 4) \).</p>

                                    <p> Example: Factor \( x^2 + 6x + 9 \).</p>
                                     Step 1: Recognize that \( 9 \) is \( 3^2 \) and \( 6 \) is \( 2 \cdot 3 \). <br>Step 2: Apply the perfect square trinomial formula: - \( x^2 + 6x + 9 = (x + 3)^2 \)
                                    <p>Thus, the factored form of \( x^2 + 6x + 9 \) is \( (x + 3)^2 \).</p>

                                    <p>Thus, the solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 2 \) and \(

                                    <h3>8.5 Completing the Square</h3>
                                    <p>Another method to solve quadratic equations is completing the square. Hereâ€™s how
                                        to do it for the same equation:</p>
                                    
                                        <p>Step 1: Move the constant to the other side.</p>
                                        <p>\( x^2 - 5x = -6 \)</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Step 2: Take half of the coefficient of \( x \), square it, and add it to both sides.</p>
                                        <p>Half of \(-5\) is \(-\frac{5}{2}\), and squaring it gives \(\frac{25}{4}\).</p>
                                        <p>\( x^2 - 5x + \frac{25}{4} = -6 + \frac{25}{4} \)</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Step 3: Simplify the right side.</p>
                                        <p>\( x^2 - 5x + \frac{25}{4} = -\frac{24}{4} + \frac{25}{4} = \frac{1}{4} \)</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Step 4: Write the left side as a square.</p>
                                        <p>\( \left(x - \frac{5}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \)</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Step 5: Take the square root of both sides.</p>
                                        <p>\( x - \frac{5}{2} = \pm \frac{1}{2} \)</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Step 6: Solve for \( x \).</p>
                                        <p>\( x = \frac{5}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 3 \) or \( x = \frac{5}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 2 \)</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Thus, the solutions are again \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).</p>

                                    <h3>8.6 Quadratic Formula</h3>
                                    <p>The quadratic formula is a universal method for solving any quadratic equation:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]</p>
                                    <p> Example:  Solve \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula.</p>
                                     Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = 6 \).
Step 1: Calculate the discriminant. D = b^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4(1)(6) = 25 - 24 = 1.

Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula. x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{1}}{2(1)} = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2}. 
                                    <p> Step 3: Solve for the two possible values of \( x \). </p>
                                  x = \frac{6}{2} = 3 or x = \frac{4}{2} = 2
                                    <p>Thus, using the quadratic formula, we again find the solutions to the equation \(
                                        x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).</p>
